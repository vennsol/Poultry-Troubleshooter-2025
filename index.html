    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy & Calm (Stone, Green, Amber) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A wizard-style, single-page application. The user starts by selecting a primary symptom category. This action triggers a series of interactive questions. Each "Yes" or "No" answer dynamically updates the view with the next logical question from a predefined data structure. This process continues until a final diagnosis and recommendation are reached, which are then displayed in a clear, formatted result card. This structure was chosen because it simplifies a complex decision-making process, guiding the user step-by-step and preventing the information overload of a long text document. A "Start Over" button allows for easy re-use. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core of the application is an interactive decision tree. Instead of static charts, the "visualization" is the user's journey through the diagnostic questions.
        - Goal: Guide diagnosis. Method: Interactive Q&A flow. Interaction: Clicking category and Yes/No buttons. Justification: Mirrors the logic of a troubleshooting guide perfectly, making it intuitive. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Goal: Present final diagnosis. Method: A styled card with clear "Probable Cause" and "Recommendations" sections. Interaction: Reading, with a button to restart. Justification: Clearly separates the conclusion from the diagnostic process. Library: N/A (HTML/CSS).
        - Goal: Provide general advice. Method: A static, easily accessible section at the bottom. Interaction: Reading. Justification: Keeps important, non-diagnostic information always available. Library: N/A (HTML/CSS).
